# 🚀 AI-Generated Drawings with CLIP Scoring

This project is part of the **Midterm for AI Image Generation**, where we use **Stable Diffusion** to create AI-generated images and apply **CLIP scoring** to evaluate text-to-image alignment.

- **Goal:** Generate images from **text prompts** and improve them using **color & style variations**.
- **Evaluation:** CLIP scoring to measure **image-text alignment**.
- **Comparison:** Before vs. after style modification.



🔧 Setup Instructions:  
1️⃣ Open Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab  
2️⃣ Run Notebook & Generate Images  
3️⃣ View the LaTeX Slides
